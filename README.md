# Mini Math Game

Project Description:

Mini Math Game is an interactive educational game that helps pre-school and first-grade kids improve their math skills. The game uses a colorful and engaging user interface with graphics, animations, and sounds to make learning fun and engaging. MathGameFrame extends JFrame and implements ActionListener to handle user events and interactions.

The game displays 10 different simple math calculating questions randomly, and lets users input their answers using a user-friendly interface. The game uses exception handling to detect incorrect inputs and provide feedback to the user. Each correct answer earns the user points, and the game keeps track of the player's name and score using a HashMap data structure.

To make the game more challenging, users can choose to play at different levels of difficulty. The game also provides hints and feedback to help users learn math concepts and improve their skills. Users can choose to start a new game, quit the game, or let the next player take their turn.

MathGameFrame also has a file I/O feature that stores the top 5 player's names and scores in a database. Users can view the leaderboard at any time during the game by pressing a button. The game uses Layout managers to make the user interface responsive and scalable on different devices and screen sizes.

MathGameFrame is written in Java and requires Java Runtime Environment to run. The game is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.
